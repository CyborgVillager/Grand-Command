               | Description: v# description |
               | --------------------------- |
 ----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v1 Respo Created: Respo created, will update it once I'm done with Grand-Expansion 2020 Update. Just going to fix the fisherman
			bug, implement a couple of upgrades & modernize the images to suit the time period for the game's setting.
			link: https://github.com/CyborgVillager/Grand-Expansion
			
			After that will start to work on this proj to add military/civ like features. Have a bit of a plan on making
			interaction with A.I/with other features that Ill get into once this respo becomes active again.


v2 Added Updated Info: Added Updated info for Grand Command, will be fixing Grand Expansion a bit then will start
                        working on this project.


v3 Redfining: studying the code and redifying the aspects, and commenting to be easier to read for future updates

v4 Re-test-clean: will be testing the code/ cleaning it up, then will work on GC and start a 'new game' to test the
                        results.

v5 Modi Start: Game can be 'started' but will crash. Will work on fixing this issue and allowing building materials, before putting
			in the military elements onto it.

v6 Temp Jeep: Added temp military jeep to the military vechs. A blueprint template is availb to be modif as well. Will be working on
			improving the design of the jeep as time goes on. Making rounded edges for a 'car' requires more work.

--v7 Begin Op: will begin to work on Grand Command & Grand Expansion shortly, have some ideas on making GC playable, and
                including military tacti for handling hostile,riots,etc triggers or events that are caused by an npc/ai.

                Other plans to include
                *Morale if a unit depending on the unit spec, will have a morale data, if that data goes to a certain # they
                  will flee the battle or action they are taking. In some cases you will lose that unit or become 'captured'
                  and possib killed or 'im-prisoned' to the hostile forces.

                 *Riot units will deal with riots/civlian issues, if the damage from riots go to a certain point the
                 city/town will stop producing resources and take in more resources from your civ. If this continues the city
                 might be over-taken by riot units and be 'controlled' by gangs

                 *Other updates to military expansion, will include scientific and soon diplo expansions as well.
                 units will be added according to the updates that are taking place

                 -Main objective get the game to start, and make farm->town->city upgrade avialb.
