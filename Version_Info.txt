v1 Respo Created: Respo created, will update it once I'm done with Grand-Expansion 2020 Update. Just going to fix the fisherman
			bug, implement a couple of upgrades & modernize the images to suit the time period for the game's setting.
			link: https://github.com/CyborgVillager/Grand-Expansion
			
			After that will start to work on this proj to add military/civ like features. Have a bit of a plan on making
			interaction with A.I/with other features that Ill get into once this respo becomes active again.


v2 Added Updated Info: Added Updated info for Grand Command, will be fixing Grand Expansion a bit then will start
                        working on this project.


v3 Redfining: studying the code and redifying the aspects, and commenting to be easier to read for future updates

v4 Re-test-clean: will be testing the code/ cleaning it up, then will work on GC and start a 'new game' to test the
                        results.

--v5 Modi Start: Game can be 'started' but will crash. Will work on fixing this issue and allowing building materials, before putting
			in the military elements onto it.
