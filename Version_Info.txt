v1 Respo Created: Respo created, will update it once I'm done with Grand-Expansion 2020 Update. Just going to fix the fisherman
			bug, implement a couple of upgrades & modernize the images to suit the time period for the game's setting.
			link: https://github.com/CyborgVillager/Grand-Expansion
			
			After that will start to work on this proj to add military/civ like features. Have a bit of a plan on making
			interaction with A.I/with other features that Ill get into once this respo becomes active again.

                        working on this project.
