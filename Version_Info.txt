               | v# : Short Version Title    |
               | Description: v# description |
               | --------------------------- |
 ----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v1 Respo Created: Respo created, will update it once I'm done with Grand-Expansion 2020 Update. Just going to fix the fisherman
			bug, implement a couple of upgrades & modernize the images to suit the time period for the game's setting.
			link: https://github.com/CyborgVillager/Grand-Expansion
			
			After that will start to work on this proj to add military/civ like features. Have a bit of a plan on making
			interaction with A.I/with other features that Ill get into once this respo becomes active again.


v2 Added Updated Info: Added Updated info for Grand Command, will be fixing Grand Expansion a bit then will start
                        working on this project.


v3 Redfining: studying the code and redifying the aspects, and commenting to be easier to read for future updates

v4 Re-test-clean: will be testing the code/ cleaning it up, then will work on GC and start a 'new game' to test the
                        results.

v5 Modi Start: Game can be 'started' but will crash. Will work on fixing this issue and allowing building materials, before putting
			in the military elements onto it.

v6 Temp Jeep: Added temp military jeep to the military vechs. A blueprint template is availb to be modif as well. Will be working on
			improving the design of the jeep as time goes on. Making rounded edges for a 'car' requires more work.

v7 Begin Op: will begin to work on Grand Command & Grand Expansion shortly, have some ideas on making GC playable, and
                including military tacti for handling hostile,riots,etc triggers or events that are caused by an npc/ai.

                Other plans to include
                *Morale if a unit depending on the unit spec, will have a morale data, if that data goes to a certain # they
                  will flee the battle or action they are taking. In some cases you will lose that unit or become 'captured'
                  and possib killed or 'im-prisoned' to the hostile forces.

                 *Riot units will deal with riots/civlian issues, if the damage from riots go to a certain point the
                 city/town will stop producing resources and take in more resources from your civ. If this continues the city
                 might be over-taken by riot units and be 'controlled' by gangs

                 *Other updates to military expansion, will include scientific and soon diplo expansions as well.
                 units will be added according to the updates that are taking place

                 -Main objective get the game to start, and make farm->town->city upgrade avialb.
 ----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
 
v8 Game Start: game is able to be open @ Grand_Command folder. Grand_Comand00 will be the testing grounds before putting
                them onto Grand_Command for the time being. Game can be start, now will be cleaning up/tidying up the code
                before implementing the updates as stated on v7 -> farm->town->city, other civ updates then the military,
                scientific,diplo aspects of it.

v9 Wiki Implement: will include wiki implement as a tut, to help aid in the modification of the game if you wish to include
                    your addons to it, as well on how to start the game, place to comment, etc.


v10 Consolidate: got the basics of the game to function/place them in their perspective source code, now going to
                consolidate the code a bit/clean it up and make it cleaner, after that will begin operation as stated
                @ v9 & v8

v11 Consolidate PT 05: modified GC_Source to have a main gc_source that will hold all of the source info from the other
                            source code. Each will have their comments detailing the main functions of each source code
                            in a organized format, will continue to consolidate the code for better readability & ease of
                            modifications.

--v12 Modified gc_source: updated the source to have ImportError, just in case any of the files are unable to import onto
                            the main gc_source.py
